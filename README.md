# JsonReader
Program that processes JSON objects received from URLs.  
_My solution of recruitment task._

## What it does?
- Downloads and combines data about [posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and [users](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) from [jsonplaceholder.typicode.com](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com)
- Counts how many posts each user wrote
- Checks if posts titles are unique
- For each user, finds the second one living closest (based on geographic coordinates)

_Program is tested with **Junit 4**_
